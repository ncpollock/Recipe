# Recipe
This is an Shiny web application for food recipes. It's built on the R programming language with transaction support from a custom built cloud-hosted database. This started as a simple project to retrieve data from a Google Sheet (i.e., main branch). This worked in production for months, but we eventually wanted more from the app than Google Sheets could handle.
